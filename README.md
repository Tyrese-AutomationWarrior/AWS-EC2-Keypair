Terraform module which creates EC2 key pair on AWS. The private key will be stored in AWS Systems Manager's Parameter Store.

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "key_pair" {
  source = "squareops/keypair/aws"

  environment        = "production"
  key_name           = "example-key"
  ssm_parameter_path = "production-example-key"
}
```
Refer [this](https://github.com/squareops/terraform-aws-keypair/tree/main/examples) for more examples.


## Retrieve Private Key

To Retrieve the Private key from SSM:
```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --region=us-east-1 --name "production-example-key" --with-decryption --output text --query Parameter.Value
```

Additionally, to save the private to a file:
```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --region=us-east-1 --name "production-example-key" --with-decryption --output text --query Parameter.Value > private-key.pem
```
